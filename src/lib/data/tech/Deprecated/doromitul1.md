# lore
i got this absolute unit back in 2021 when it was still basically impossible to get a graphics card outside of just getting a prebuilt PC that had it included
<br>
one of the first things i did when i got it was install some linux distro on it, i don't remember which one it was exactly
<br>
<br>
as of writing this, i recently converted my pc from being used like any other pc to this weird setup where i literally don't have a display on my desk, there's nothing plugged into my PC
<br>
<br>
the way i did that was:

1. i stopped using oses on the bare metal
2. i installed sunshine on the vms
3. i added an EDID file to trick the GPU into thinking a display is actually plugged into it

the result of this is really cool but also really weird

but hey, i have free space on my desk again

now, my displays are:

- my macbook
- my quest 3
