## lore
For the longest time, i was using a lenovo thinkvision t24i-10Â which was fine for most tasks but the main issue with it was that it only had a 60hz refresh rate (which is fine for productivity tasks but leaves a lot to be desired for gaming).
<br>
<br>
So in 2.9.2025 i decided to order a replacement for it and picked it up the day after.
<br>
I took it home, plugged it in and it worked fine until i noticed some artifacts in the bottom right corner of my screen.
<br>
I at first thought it was a software issue so i rebooted my PC. 
<br>
After i did that, though, there was no video out and my PC beeped out that there's a graphics issue.
<br>
I thought my GPU was fried (because in case you didn't know, i overclocked it and increased power consumption limits) but later i remembered that this issue didn't happen until i got my new monitor (and FYI, i was using displayport until that point).
<br>
So i plugged my PC to my old monitor and magically, it worked.
<br>
Turns out, it was a faulty HDMI adapter that caused me a really stressful evening. Oof.
