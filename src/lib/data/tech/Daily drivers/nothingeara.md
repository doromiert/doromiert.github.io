## lore
I bought it because my old headphones split in half and i had to tape them back together (not joking).

On the third day of using these, i accidentally put the case in my pants in such a way that it opened and that caused the lid to fall off and i couldn't return it because x-kom doesn't cover mechanical defects (ouch).
