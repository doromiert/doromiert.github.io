## lore
i finally decided to upgrade from doromi tul I and this time, i got really lucky when it comes to the components in this machine
<br>
<br>
first, i found the RX 6900XT for just 1500z≈Ç (that's like 30% of its original msrp!). i got it from what seems to be a guy who shits money, he lives in the middle of nowhere in a villa
<br>
<br>
i originally planned to get an rtx 5070, but hickensa told me that this is gonna be a way better choice, especially considering that it's actually cheaper (which means more money for other components, yay!)
<br>
<br>
then i went to x-kom to get the rest of the components since my dad didn't really trust olx that much. so the store guy recommended me to get the components i have (but instead of the ryzen 9 7900, he told me to get a ryzen 7 7700)
<br>
<br>
next day, i picked up the motherboard and ram but decided to actually get the ryzen 9 7900 on allegro, which arrived the next day
<br>
<br>
after picking up the cpu, i went to pick up the pc case but the issue with it is that i accidentally ordered a miniATX case instead of a full ATX one. so i had to return it and get a proper ATX case
<br>
<br>
luckily, after putting everything together, it actually worked on the first try, all i had to do was update the bios and change one line of proxmox configuration for it to be ready for normal use
